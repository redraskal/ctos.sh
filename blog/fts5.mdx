## SQLite is fast, especially when using Bun.

When I started working on a <a href="https://github.com/redraskal/clips" target="_blank">video game clip website</a>, I wanted fast search capabilities without sacrificing simplicity. The platform needed to be lightweight and trivial to set up on a home server. During my research, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html" target="_blank">SQLite FTS5 Extension</a>, which provides powerful full-text search functionality.

To make this functionality available, I contributed <a href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/3431" target="_blank">FTS5 support</a> to Bun's bundled SQLite implementation by adding the `-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5=1` compilation flag. This integration means you can use powerful full-text search capabilities right out of the box with Bun.

Here's an example of FTS5 on Bun:

```ts
it('supports FTS5', () => {
  const db = new Database();
  db.run("CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE movies USING fts5(title, tokenize='trigram')");

  const insert = db.prepare('INSERT INTO movies VALUES ($title)');
  const insertMovies = db.transaction((movies) => {
    for (const movie of movies) insert.run(movie);
  });

  insertMovies([
    { $title: 'The Shawshank Redemption' },
    { $title: 'WarGames' },
    { $title: 'Interstellar' },
    { $title: 'Se7en' },
    { $title: 'City of God' },
    { $title: 'Spirited Away' },
  ]);

  expect(db.query("SELECT * FROM movies('game')").all()).toEqual([{ title: 'WarGames' }]);
});
```

I typically prefer the `trigram` tokenization method as it provides more flexible matching capabilities across a wider range of search patterns. This approach breaks text into three-character segments, allowing for partial matches and typo tolerance without requiring exact keyword matches.

For my clips website, this approach provided exactly what I needed - lightning-fast search without the complexity of setting up and maintaining a separate search service.

## Cool feature - table-valued function syntax

The FTS5 documentation is quite long and there are some interesting insights to gather from it.

For instance, you may use the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html#tabfunc2" target="_blank">table-valued function syntax</a> for search terms.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies('game');
```

is the same as

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title = 'game';
```

If you're building an application that needs search capabilities but want to keep your stack simple, I encourage you to explore SQLite with FTS5. It's surprisingly powerful for its size and integrates seamlessly with Bun's JavaScript runtime.

Happy coding!

```bash
# macOS & Linux
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
# windows
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```
